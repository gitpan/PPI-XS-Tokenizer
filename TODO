This is just what I noticed in passing, feel free to expand --Steffen

- Transform "magics" and "operators" instance data in Tokenizer
  into static/class data
- Style: Stick to either foo_bar or camelCase notation for members and
  methods. Either use the m_foo or the fFoo syntax for member names
  (and specifically use some consistent syntax whatever it is).
- freeToken (or free_token or whatever) should be an object method of
  the tokens? Maybe?
